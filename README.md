Basic Transformer Visualizer
This Streamlit application allows you to visualize the architecture of a Hugging Face Transformer model. Enter the name of a pre-trained model (e.g., distilbert-base-uncased), and the app will generate an interactive network graph showing its layers and their connections, along with brief explanations of common layer types.

Features
Model Visualization: Dynamically generates a directed graph of the transformer model's internal structure.
Layer Explanations: Provides tooltips with brief descriptions for common layer types like embedding, attention, linear, dropout, and layernorm.
Interactive Graph: Built with pyvis, allowing you to zoom, pan, and drag nodes in the visualization.
How to Use
Clone the repository (or save the app.py file):

Bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
(If you only have app.py, just make sure it's in a directory.)

Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
Enter a model name: In the Streamlit interface, type the name of a Hugging Face pre-trained model (e.g., bert-base-uncased, gpt2, distilbert-base-uncased) into the text input field.

Click "Visualize Model": The application will load the model and display its architecture as a graph.

Example
Enter distilbert-base-uncased and click "Visualize Model" to see its structure.
